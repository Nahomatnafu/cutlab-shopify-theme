1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `julian-prohaska-shopify-theme`
3. Description: `Custom Shopify Online Store 2.0 theme for Julian Prohaska - Modern minimal clothing brand design`
4. Choose **Public** or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create repository**

**Option B: Install GitHub CLI (Recommended for future)**
```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI via winget
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Then create repo
gh auth login
gh repo create julian-prohaska-shopify-theme --public --source=. --description "Custom Shopify Online Store 2.0 theme for Julian Prohaska - Modern minimal clothing brand design"
```

### 2. Push to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```powershell
# Add the remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/julian-prohaska-shopify-theme.git

# Push master branch
git checkout master
git push -u origin master

This will:

### 5. Upload to Shopify Store

```

**Publish the theme:**
1. Go to your Shopify Admin: **Online Store > Themes**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Reference Code**: The original Next.js code is preserved in `Static-Shopify-Theme-Frontend-codebase/` for reference

4. **Line Endings**: Git warnings about LF/CRLF are normal on Windows - they're automatically handled
